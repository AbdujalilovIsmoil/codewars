# Interview Question (easy)

You receive the name of a city as a string, and you need to return a string that shows how many times each letter shows up in the string by using asterisks (\*).

For example:

"Chicago" --> "c:\*_,h:_,i:_,a:_,g:_,o:_"
As you can see, the letter c is shown only once, but with 2 asterisks.

The return string should include only the letters (not the dashes, spaces, apostrophes, etc). There should be no spaces in the output, and the different letters are separated by a comma (,) as seen in the example above.

Note that the return string must list the letters in order of their first appearance in the original string.

More examples:

"Bangkok" --> "b:_,a:_,n:_,g:_,k:**,o:_"
"Las Vegas" --> "l:_,a:**,s:\*_,v:_,e:_,g:_"

Have fun!
